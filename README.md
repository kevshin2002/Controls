# Welcome to Controls!
Welcome to my repository containing all of my work related to controls. I hope to have practical projects in here as I pursue my career but due to financial costs, I have only been doing theoretical work. So if you are interested in any of them, take a look!

## Table of Contents
- [Linear Control Systems](https://github.com/kevshin2002/Controls/tree/main) \
Design and analysis of observers, controllers, state feedback controller, and kalman filters using LQR, Ricatti Equation, and Reachability/Observability matrices.
- [Linear Electronic Systems](https://github.com/kevshin2002/Controls/tree/main/Linear%20Electronic%20Systems) \
Design and analysis of circuits with capacitors and op-amps, focusing on the application of control theory to minimize noise.
